Instacart Data Analysis for CareerFoundry

Youâ€™re an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store
that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they
want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Your task is to
perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order
to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on
the provided criteria.

There are four folders included in this analysis.  The Project Management folder 
contains the project brief.  The Scripts folder contains zip files of all the Scripts
that were used for Python/Jupyter.  The Analysis folder has reports and visualizations
relating to the project.  The Sent to Client folder contains the final project and
presentation sent to the client.
